		<h1>Welcome to Component Development</h1>
		<p> <b>C&sup3;</b> is an extension to Java language which provides you new <b>Component</b> features. Component will help you structure your softwares. It is a great tool to avoid spaghetti coding. It is not intended to replace object, but it adds new higher abstractions which can be seen as black boxes. With it, it is easier to divide your source code in a human understable manner. <b>C&sup3;</b> comes also whith some features attached to black box which will help you to better control data flow between the different components and also their dependencies.</p>
		<p>As the adage says <i>"A picture is worth a thousand words"</i>, have a look to the below picture on which you are able to see the main abstractions of <b>C&sup3;</b> component </p>
